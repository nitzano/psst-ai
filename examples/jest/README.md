This is an example project demonstrating Jest configuration patterns that can be detected by the JestScanner.

## Features Demonstrated

- TypeScript support with ts-jest
- JSdom test environment for DOM testing
- Code coverage configuration with thresholds
- Setup files for test environment configuration
- Module name mapping for path aliases
- CSS/asset mocking
- Fake timers configuration
- Custom test timeout

## Usage
